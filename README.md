## Job-Tracker Web App:
+ Job-Tracker Web Application allows user's to manage job applications and resumes.
+ User need needs to add the job applications (manually for now!).

## Why do we need to track our job applications?
+ Tracking and Managing job applications has various advantages while looking for jobs. I can give you some examples, like:
   + You can monitor yourself, how regular you are applying for jobs.
   + Tracking yourself, gives you the data and helps you to figureout, what needs to be improved.
   + You will learn about patterns, that changes are actually helpful while job search.

## Why we are creating an app like this?
+ Applying 3-5 jobs daily, easily piles-up the number of job applications.
+ It's impossible to track them all within our mind.
+ I used to use Excel sheet, but always felt Excel is not the best suited for this purpose.
+ As I needed various other features, that is not present in Excel.
+ So, I want to create an app that specifically solves this problem.

## How can this app help us?
+ You can follow similar people like you.
+ Which will help you to search jobs more efficiently.
+ You can search good and relevant job 2-3/day. Searching more than this will definately consume your time more.
+ But following more people like you, can easily reduce you time and effort.
+ Which allows you to invest more in your skills, rather than hunting for a job, whole day.

+ Hint & Tips section allows you to learn about new way to bypass ATS, or how can you imporve your job hunt process.
+ Also creates a database of companies for you. Sometimes you are really interested in many company but totally forgets about them after few days.
